  ## Installation

  To Install necessary dependencies, run the following command:
  
  npm i

  ## Usage

      First you will need to create a business account. Once done, you can log in and edit your profile, create customers, review customers, search for customer by first name(only option right now) and/or edit previouse reviews you have made. The customers displayed on your home page are customers you created. If you are a individual and you see your card, click view profile and claim your account. If your email matches that which the business provided then you will be able to create a password and then you will have access to your profile. Currently there is no benifit to this as that is a future development issue where the customer could then edit his/her/them prifile.
